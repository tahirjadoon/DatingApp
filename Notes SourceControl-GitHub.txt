We are placing both Angular and API in GIT repository

.gitignore is already in the Angular app. We'll need to create one for the API.

Important, we are putting the apps inside a single repository. 

1. Download and install
	https://git-scm.com/downloads
	After the install, type git in the command prompt to check.
	If it fails then following this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4492979/git-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command 
	
	Go to environment variables and make sure that the following two are under SystemVariables\Path	
    C:\Program Files\Git\bin\
    C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\

	
	If you get into environment variable length issue then look at 
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34491244/environment-variable-is-too-large-on-windows-10

    1. Remove the duplicate paths (right click > Cleanup Paths)
    2. Remove non-existent folders (shown in red which you need to manually delete)
    3. Replace long paths with short paths (right click > long to short path).

2. Initializing the git repository
	We will be placing both the projects in one repo so that the notes can go in as well. Go to te parent folder in terminal or command prompt and type
	>git init 

	you might need to close and re-open vs code. Setup repo on github and pick its path 
	
3. Go to Source Control, on the Changes line, click + and then click tick mark on source control line to commit. 

4. Go to github and create a new repository, without readme

	My repository in this case is : https://github.com/tahirjadoon/DatingApp.git

	It will also give commands on the create page

	4.a 
	or create a new repository on the command line
	
	echo "# DatingApp" >> README.md
	git init [already done]
	git add README.md [already done]
	git commit -m "first commit" [already done]
	git remote add origin https://github.com/tahirjadoon/DatingApp.git [Pick and go back to VS Code]
	git push -u origin master

	4.b 
	or push an existing repository from the command line
	
	git remote add origin https://github.com/tahirjadoon/DatingApp.git
	git push -u origin master

5.
	Pick and paste the following on command prompt, at the root level
	git remote add origin https://github.com/tahirjadoon/DatingApp.git

	Inside the source control, on Source Control line, you should see Git. Click on the 3 dots and then click on Push To
